# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis uses Machine Learning and Neural Networks to create a binary classifier to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
- The target variable for the model would be "IS_SUCCESSFUL Column
- Featured columns are "APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT"
- Removed variables "EIN, NAME"
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- This deep-learning neural network model is made of two hidden layers with 80 and 30 neurons respectively.
The input data has 43 features and 25,724 samples. The first and second hidden layer have the "relu" activation function and the activation function for the output layer is "sigmoid."
